# 3D Printed 12-pin CRT socket
---
A 3D printable 12-pin (actually 10, because I'm using a 2BP1) socket for electrostatically driven CRTs. I got the idea when I realized the crimp terminals from Molex connectors also fit the pins on old CRTs.

Instructions: 
* Print socket. No supports needed, tested on Ender 3 printed in PLA at 0.1mm layer height
* Use Molex crimp terminals (Molex part number 02091104) as connection points

NOTE: the interior of the connector is not just a straight hole. There is internal geometry (see below). It has to be done like this or the CRT will either pull out of the socket, or the terminals will pull out of the CRT.
